    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These have been voted the number one cookie that I bake (and I bake a lot!),
    and are loved by all who eat them. They are chewy mapley good! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>0.25 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>0.5 cups margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp real maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>0.5 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>0.25 cups maple sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the flour,
            baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and 1 cup of white sugar
            until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and maple syrup. Gradually blend
            in the dry ingredients until just mixed. In a small dish, mix together the
            remaining 0.5 cups white sugar and the maple sugar. Roll dough into 1 inch
            balls, and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches
            apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
        </li>
        <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be crackly on top
            and look wet in the middle. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
        </li>
    </ol>
