        <li>2 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>12 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>0.33 cups maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange half the bread cubes 
            in the dish, and top with cream cheese cubes. Sprinkle 1 cup blueberries 
            over the cream cheese, and top with remaining bread cubes.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and syrup. Pour over 
            the bread cubes. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the bread cube mixture from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before 
            baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Cover, and bake 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking 25 to 30 minutes, 
            until center is firm and surface is lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, mix the sugar, cornstarch, and water. Bring to a boil. 
            Stirring constantly, cook 3 to 4 minutes. Mix in the remaining 1 cup blueberries. 
            Reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes, until the blueberries burst. Stir in the butter, 
            and pour over the baked French toast.
